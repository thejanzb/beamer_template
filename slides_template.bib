    abstract = "The Kolmogorov-Prandtl turbulence energy hypothesis is formulated in a way which is valid for the laminar sublayer as well as the fully turbulent region of a one-dimensional flow. The necessary constants are fitted to available experimental data. Numerical solutions are obtained for Couette flow with turbulence augmentation and pressure gradient and for turbulent duct flow. Reasonable agreement with available experimental data is obtained. Some new dimensionless groups are used and shown to be superior to the ones based on the friction velocity. The effects of turbulence augmentation and pressure gradient on the velocity and temperature distribution are studied. It is found that the solutions tend to approach solutions for limiting cases. The results are plotted in some figures in Section 5."
